# Functional Requirements Document: JudicialSync

**Project Acronym:** JudicialSync
**Document Type:** FRD (Functional Requirements Document)
**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Draft
**Generated:** 2026-10-06
**Source PRD:** `PRD-JudicialSync.md`

---

## Scope

This FRD translates JudicialSync's 12 PRD features (F0–F11) into implementation-ready specifications: data model, process flows, inputs/outputs, validation rules, error states, API surface, and schema surface. It is grounded in one non-negotiable architectural constraint established by project research (`SUMMARY.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `PITFALLS.md`): **status, objections/rulings, and custody are modeled exclusively as an append-only event ledger**, never as mutable "current state" fields. Every UI screen and every Pivota Assistant answer reads through one shared service layer over this ledger and its derived current-state projections — there is no parallel retrieval path, which is what makes assistant citations trustworthy.

This document is written for developers implementing JudicialSync and assumes familiarity with the PRD's feature priorities and the project's demo-first context (seeded data, no production auth, single-case scope).

## How to Read This Document

- **Feature chunks (`F00`–`F11`)** map 1:1 to PRD features F0–F11. Each chunk is self-contained (description, process, inputs/outputs, validation, errors) but defers full DDL to `Y0-schema.md` and full endpoint contracts to `Y1-api.md`.
- **Cross-feature chunks (`Y0`–`Y3`)** consolidate schema, API, error catalog, and integrations so there is one canonical definition of each, referenced (not duplicated) by every feature chunk.
- **IDs:** Feature IDs (`F0`–`F11`) match the PRD exactly. Database entity names use `PascalCase` (Prisma model convention). API paths use `kebab-case`. Event types use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`.
- **Cross-references** appear as `see F03 §Process step 2` or `see Y0-schema.md §Event Ledger`.
- **"Derived"** means a value is computed/projected from the event ledger at write-time or read-time and must never be treated as independently editable ground truth.

## Cross-Cutting Terminology

These terms recur across multiple feature chunks and are defined once here to avoid drift.

- **Event Ledger (`ExhibitEvent`):** The single append-only table recording every status change, objection, ruling, and custody transfer for every exhibit. Rows are immutable once written — never updated, never deleted. This is the system's ground truth (see `Y0-schema.md` §Event Ledger).
- **Current-State Projection:** A denormalized, derived table (`ExhibitCurrentState`, `ObjectionCurrentState`, `CustodyCurrentState`, `DiscrepancyFlag`) recomputed from the event ledger on every relevant write. Projections exist purely for fast reads; if a projection table were dropped and rebuilt by replaying the ledger in order, the result must be identical. UI screens and assistant tools read projections for "current" questions and the ledger directly for "history" questions.
- **Service Layer:** The single set of typed TypeScript functions (e.g., `getExhibits`, `getCustodian`, `getUnresolvedObjections`, `recordEvent`, `computeJuryPackage`) that is the *sole* entry point for both UI screens (via API routes) and the Pivota Assistant (via tool wrappers). No screen and no assistant tool queries Prisma directly — all access funnels through this layer so that a UI screen and an assistant answer can never diverge.
- **Objection Thread:** The logical lifecycle of a single objection, beginning with an `OBJECTION_RAISED` event and optionally closed by a `RULING_RECORDED` event referencing the same `objection_id`. A single exhibit may have multiple independent, concurrently-open objection threads.
- **Discrepancy:** A system-detected mismatch between what the current-state projection shows and what it logically should show (e.g., admitted exhibit with no custodian of record). Discrepancies are computed by rule, not manually flagged, and persist as `DiscrepancyFlag` rows until resolved or explicitly acknowledged (acknowledgment itself is a ledger event — see F6).
- **Citation:** A reference embedded in every Pivota Assistant factual claim, pointing to a specific `ExhibitEvent.id` (or current-state projection row id) and its timestamp. An answer with no citation is only valid when it is an explicit "I don't have that information" response.
- **Role:** One of `JUDGE`, `CHAMBERS_STAFF`, `DEPUTY`, `CLERK`, `ATTORNEY`, `ADMIN` — see §Role-Based Visibility below. Assigned per seeded `User` row; the demo uses a role switcher (no production auth) per PROJECT.md scope.
- **Sealed Exhibit:** An exhibit flagged `is_sealed = true` at creation (e.g., sidebar/in-camera material). Sealed exhibits are excluded from both UI queries and assistant tool results for roles outside the visibility set defined below, with no indication to the excluded role that a sealed record even exists (not just redacted content).
- **Tool-Calling (Assistant):** The Pivota Assistant answers exclusively via LLM tool-calls that are thin 1:1 wrappers around service-layer functions (see F7, `Y1-api.md` §Assistant). No retrieval-augmented generation, no embeddings, no vector search — the data is small, structured, and exact-citation-critical.

### Role-Based Visibility

| Role | Sees Sealed Exhibits? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `JUDGE` | Yes | Full visibility, including chambers-only annotations |
| `CHAMBERS_STAFF` | Yes | Mirrors judge visibility |
| `ADMIN` | Yes | Compliance/audit review requires full visibility |
| `DEPUTY` | No | Operational role; sealed material is chambers-restricted |
| `CLERK` | No | Maintains official record but not sealed/in-camera content |
| `ATTORNEY` | No | Unless individually granted access via a future ACL (out of scope for demo — default deny) |

This table is the single source of truth for role scoping and is applied identically by every API route and every assistant tool (see F7 §Validation, `Y2-errors.md` §Authorization).
